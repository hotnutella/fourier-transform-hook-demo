# Fourier Transform Hook Demo

This project is a live demonstration of the `react-use-pitch-recognition` hook in action. It showcases real-time pitch detection from audio input using the user's microphone. The demo visualizes the detected pitch frequency and corresponding musical note with a dynamic ball visualizer component.

## Live Demo

## Features

- **Real-Time Pitch Detection**: Utilizes the microphone to listen to audio input and detects the pitch in real time.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: A ball visualizer that moves vertically based on the detected pitch frequency.
- **Musical Note Identification**: Displays the detected pitch's frequency in Hertz (Hz) and the corresponding musical note.

## How to Use

1. Visit the [demo page](https://hotnutella.github.io/fourier-transform-hook-demo/).
2. Allow the application to access your microphone when prompted.
3. Produce sound (e.g., by playing a musical instrument or singing) near your microphone to see the pitch detection in action.
